### Why TypeScript?

TypeScript keeps the JS' duck typing shit at bay. It allows developing large, complex apps while giving confidence in the codebase.

### Why React?

React aids in building complex UIs by offering simple abstractions and keeping all the DOM manipulation under the hood. Its declarative approach makes frontend development as painless as possible.
